# Impact of PCA Dimensionality Reduction on Classification Algorithm Performance using Hepatitis Dataset

<p align="justify">Hepatitis is an inflammatory liver disease caused by viral infections, resulting in damage to liver cells and organ function. Accurate prediction of hepatitis patient outcomes and proper decision-making are crucial for providing effective treatment and improving patient survival. In the field of medical data modeling, such as hepatitis datasets, a major challenge is the high dimensionality of the data due to the abundance of available features. This complexity leads to time-consuming modeling. One method used to address this issue is dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, this study aims to compare the performance of three classification models, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), on hepatitis datasets before and after dimensionality reduction using PCA. The hepatitis dataset used is obtained from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/46/hepatitis">UCI Machine Learning Repository website</a>. The results of the study demonstrate that dimensionality reduction using PCA improves the performance of the Logistic Regression model while reducing the performance of the Decision Tree model. Meanwhile, the performance of the KNN model remains stable.</p>
